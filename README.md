# prusa_exporter

Prusa Exporter or more known as prusa_exporter is a tool that allows users to expose metrics from the Prusa Research 3D printers. Its approach is to scrape metrics from [Prusa Link](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/prusa-connect-and-prusalink-explained_302608) REST API and also from [UDP](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-Buddy/blob/master/doc/metrics.md) type of metrics. After gettng data it's simply exposes the metrics at `/metrics/prusalink` and `/metrics/udp` endpoints. You can also access `http://localhost:10009`.

**I strongly recommend to connect printers via Ethernet as WiFi is not considered stable**

**UDP** is configured in printer - Settings -> Network -> Metrics & Log

**BEWARE** - Altrough Prusa Mini sends some metrics via UDP as well, it's board does not contain needed sensors. So that means you are basically unable to get anything meaningful from those metrics. 

- Host => address where prusa_exporter is running aka your computer / server
- Metrics Port => default 8514 same as prusa_exporter but you can change it
- Enable Metrics => enable
- Metrics List => list of enabled metrics
  - You can select all but it has actual impact on performance so choose wisely

List of metrics needed for dashboard (values differs between printers)
- ttemp_noz
- temp_noz
- ttemp_bed
- temp_bed
- chamber_temp
- temp_mcu
- temp_hbr
- loadcell_value
- curr_inp
- volt_bed
- eth_out
- eth_in

Of course you can configure metrics with gcode as well - that gcode can be found [here](docs/examples/syslog/config_full.gcode) as well

```
M330 SYSLOG
M334 192.168.20.20 8514
M331 ttemp_noz
M331 temp_noz
M331 ttemp_bed
M331 temp_bed
M331 chamber_temp
M331 temp_mcu
M331 temp_hbr
M331 loadcell_value
M331 curr_inp
M331 volt_bed
M331 eth_out
M331 eth_in
```

**Prusa Link** is configured with [prusa.yml](docs/config/prusa.yml) where you need to fill - Settings -> Network -> PrusaLink

- `address` of the printer
- `username` => default `maker`
- `password` for Prusa Link
- `name` of the printer
  - your chosen name => just use basic name non standard - type
- `type` - model of the printer
  - MK3.9 / MK4 / MK4S / XL / Core One ...

### Dashboard

Pretty basic but nice and cozy [dashboard](docs/Prusa%20Metrics%20MK4_C1-1747124111854.json) for TV.
